= Sass on Heroku

Rails plugin to compile Sass files to tmp/ and serve from there, avoiding trouble with read-only filesystems.

It will add a Rack middleware on top of your Rails app that quickly detects requests for Sass CSS files, and serve them with caching headers.

If you have issues please tell us on support.heroku.com -- or just fork it :)
