# Represents a preferred value for a particular preference on a model.
# 
# == Grouped preferences
# 
# In addition to simple named preferences, preferences can also be grouped by
# a particular value, be it a string or ActiveRecord object.  For example, a
# User may have a preferred color for a particular Car.  In this case, the
# +owner+ is the User record, the +name+ is "color", and the +group+ is the
# Car record.  This allows preferences to have a sort of context around them.

    # primitives, the id will be nil.  For complex types, specifically
    # ActiveRecord objects, the id is the unique identifier stored in the
    # database for the record.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   Preference.split_group('google')      # => [nil, "google"]
    #   Preference.split_group(1)             # => [nil, 1]
    #   Preference.split_group(User.find(1))  # => [1, "User"]
