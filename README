Active geohasher

this will provide useful tools for geohashers, most notably the option to subscribe to graticules and receive email/rss notifications of current locations. it will include a geokit lookup for the location name and distance from your home location.

currently work in progress; nothing to see yet except an implementation of rpx login! :)
