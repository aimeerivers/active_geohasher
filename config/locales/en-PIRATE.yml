      what_data_do_you_collect_about_me:
        question: What data do you collect about me?
        answer: We store your name, email address and identifying URL for authentication. If you pinpoint a location we will save that in order to provide you with relative distances to geohashes. We will store the graticules to which you subscribe in order to provide you with a useful service.

      can_i_view_and_change_the_data_you_hold:
        question: Can I view and change the data you hold about me?
        answer: "You can. If you are logged in and click on your name, or if you visit {{link}} you will see the data we have. You can change your name and email address. You can see your identifying URL but you cannot change it because it is needed for authentication. You can change your subscriptions or home location at any time."

      why_do_you_want_my_facebook_details:
        question: Why do you want my Facebook details? Will you spam my friends?
        answer: "Definitely not. The RPX authentication is simply a means of verifying who you are from a trusted third party site, be it Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo or any OpenID provider. We will have no knowledge of your friends, and we will not be able to post to your Twitter account or Facebook status. See {{link}} if you want to know more."

      an_algorithm_takes_the_dow_jones: "{{an_algorithm}} takes the opening value of the Dow Jones and combines it with the current date to produce geographic points in every latitude and longitude all over the world. The coordinates could land anywhere: maybe in a forest, in the middle of the sea, or in a big city. Maybe even {{at_your_home}} or {{your_workplace}}! But it's completely random, and it's different every day."

      the_aim_of_the_game: "The aim of the game is to reach one of the geohash points for the day (maybe with the aid of GPS equipment), take photographs for evidence, meet other people, play games, do what ever you feel like. Ideally leave some kind of {{non_permanent_marker}} for others to find."
      non_permanent_marker: non-permanent marker
      there_are_several_achievements: "There are several {{achievements}} that you can earn depending on difficulty or activities you carry out at the geohash point. But the main point is to enjoy yourself, get out into the fresh air, go somewhere you might have no reason to go otherwise and share your adventures with the rest of us!"
